Below is a sample post demonstrating how to upload and display code lines in your GitHub blog using Markdown.

Let's work on it!

### 01. Hello World in Python

~~~python
print("Hello, World!")
~~~

This is the most basic Python command. It prints a string to the console.

### 02. Variables and Data Types in Python

~~~python
name = "Junhee"
age = 21
is_student = True

print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old.")
~~~

In this example:
- `name` is a string
- `age` is an integer
- `is_student` is a boolean

We also use **f-string formatting** to print variables inside a string.
